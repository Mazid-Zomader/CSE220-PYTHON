# Lab 05 - Solving Techniques  

## I want to mention that I currently have several confusions regarding the solving techniques used in this lab. I am working on clarifying these concepts and techniques, but it may take some time to fully resolve them.  

If you have any suggestions or feedback on the approaches I have attempted so far, I would greatly appreciate it.  

Thank you for your understanding and support!
