# ðŸ“‚ Sorting Algorithms in PYTHON

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms** folder! 

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms written in **Python**.

## ðŸ“œ Algorithms Included:
- ðŸ§® **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- ðŸ§® **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts, and repeatedly selects 
     the smallest element from the unsorted part.
- ðŸ§® **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one element at a time, much like sorting playing cards.
- ðŸ§® **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- ðŸ§® **Quick Sort**: A fast, recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts.
